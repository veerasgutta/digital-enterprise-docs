  - Technology-agnostic agent orchestration 
  - Automatic application discovery and registration
  - Intelligent agent-to-module assignment
  - Web-based orchestration dashboard (Port 9000)
  - Support for multiple frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, Next.js)
  - Support for multiple backend technologies (.NET, Python, Node.js)
  - Real-time system monitoring and health checks
- Master Agent hierarchical orchestrator management system
- Health monitoring with 30-second intervals and auto-restart

- Comprehensive README documentation for scripts and configuration

### Changed
- **üîÑ Architectural Revolution** - Agents are now completely decoupled from specific codebases
  - Agents can manage ANY technology stack dynamically
  - Zero vendor lock-in - switch frameworks without changing agents
  - Hot deployment capabilities with zero downtime
- Moved all utility scripts to organized `scripts/` directory structure
- Relocated configuration files to centralized `config/` directory
- Updated main README with improved quick start and organization references
- Enhanced project structure for better maintainability

### Revolutionary Features
- **üéØ Hot-Swapping**: Replace React with Vue.js while system is running
- **üîç Auto-Discovery**: Automatically detect and register applications
- **ü§ñ Intelligent Assignment**: Best agent automatically chosen for each module
- **üåê Technology Freedom**: Mix and match any frontend/backend combinations
- **üìä Real-time Monitoring**: Live dashboard for entire ecosystem
- **üöÄ Future-Proof**: Easy to add support for new technologies
- Organized documentation files into centralized documentation/ folder
- Improved project structure and file organization
- Enhanced README with comprehensive platform overview
- Updated .gitignore to exclude logs, Python cache, and virtual environments

### Fixed
- Syntax errors in orchestrator files
- Process management and lifecycle handling
- Port conflict resolution
- Graceful shutdown procedures

### In Progress
- Development Orchestrator Redis dependency compatibility with Python 3.13
- Unicode display issues in Windows console (cosmetic only)

## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-21

### Added
- Initial multi-agent platform implementation
- Master Agent with process management capabilities
- Three-tier orchestrator architecture
- Health monitoring and auto-recovery system
- Web dashboard and REST API endpoints
- .NET Core backend application
- React frontend application
- Autonomous AI platform foundation
- Comprehensive documentation suite
- GitOps and infrastructure setup
- Testing framework and CI/CD pipeline

### Technical Achievements
